### Hello World 👋

I'm Gabriel Mendes de Paulo 😁<br/>
I'm a Fullstack Developer/Computer Engineering student that loves coding. I code since i was 15yo, and that's my true passion. My first language was Lua, but now my stack is totally different.<br/>

I'm currently working at Dotlib as a Full Stack.<br/>

My current focus on learning is Go, but i'm always looking into improving myself on what i already know.<br/>

You can feel free to contact me at Linkedin, even if just to meet me. 😂<br/>
