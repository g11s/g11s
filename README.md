📫 Meet me! [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dev-gabriel-mendes)

I'm currently working at [BTG Pactual](https://www.btgpactual.com/) as a <code>Backend Engineer</code>.

I love learning new things, so I try to learn anything new every day<br/>

You can feel free to contact me on Linkedin, even if just to meet me. 😂<br/>

⚡ <b>Fun Fact:</b> I really love <code>Node</code> and <code>React</code>, simplicity always makes me very curious.

<b>What about knowing about some projects created by me?</b><br/>
